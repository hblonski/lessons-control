# LessonsControl App

This was my first Android App! :)

In the middle of 2018 I was having piano lessons, and my teacher was having trouble to manage his students and their payment schedules. This situation led me to give my first steps in Android development, by developing this simple app.

As I had years of experience with Java, it was the obvious language choice. Later, I started to learn Kotlin, and thus created a new branch, to which I migrated the whole code. My next step was to start developing tests. By then, I had enrolled on the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program, and for matters of time, I was forced me to pause this little personal project. A refactory on the layout is going to be done soon, as well as finishing the tests.

This app lets you register students as well as their lessons, and assign to them information such as student contact details, lesson price, schedule, etc.
